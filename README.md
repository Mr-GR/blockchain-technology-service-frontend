# Certification NFT - Soulbound Digital Credentials

A blockchain-based certification system using non-transferable (soulbound) NFTs for issuing verifiable credentials on Polygon Amoy testnet.

## Overview

Certification NFT is a decentralized application that enables institutions, bootcamps, and organizations to issue tamper-proof, verifiable digital certificates as NFTs. These certificates are **soulbound** (non-transferable), ensuring they permanently represent the recipient's achievement.

### Key Features

- **Soulbound NFTs** - Certificates cannot be transferred or sold
-  **Verifiable Credentials** - On-chain proof of achievement
-  **Admin Panel** - Easy certificate issuance interface
-  **Certificate Gallery** - Beautiful display of earned certificates
-  **Verification Tool** - Anyone can verify certificate ownership
-  **Blockchain Transparency** - All data publicly verifiable on Polygonscan
